# Sublime Simplest Debugger

It is straightforward plugin for [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/) to add or remove "debugger" statement. It can be useful for ruby and javascript developers.

## Usage

Use shortcut (&#8984;+&#8679;+d) to toggle debugger statement. I know that this shortcut is using for line duplication, but I dont use it:) Change this hotkey in plugin settings if you want.
You can also use command "SimplestDebugger: Toggle" from command palette, but really, typing "debugger" in your code is quickly.

## Installation
Install Simplest Debugger from [package control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).

Or fetch from github:

    git clone git://github.com/KELiON/SimplestDebugger.git

and place it in your packages directory.
